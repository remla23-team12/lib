# Library

The lib repository requires a library that the app repository will depend on. The app repository will intall the lib through a package manager (PyPI). The library has to be published as a package in the same programming language as the app repository.

Changing the below number by incrementing the PATCH version + 1 will trigger the automated workflow (e.g., 0.0.5 --> 0.0.6)
Note: you need to change init.py,readme,setup 

Release 0.1.1
